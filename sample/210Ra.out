210RA c  {+214}Th |e branch was estimated by 1995El07 as |<0.2% from the |b     
210RA2c  gross theory of 1973Ta30. The r{-0} parameter, calculated by using     
210RA3c  %|a=99.9 {I1}, fits the local r{-0} trend.                             
210RA D  NO CALCULATION FOR T1/2(EC) OF 214TH IS GIVEN IN 1997MoZW.             
210RA c  The partial half-life for {+214}Th |b{++} decay was                    
210RA2c  calculated by 1997Mo25 as 19.4328 s, which gives %|b{++}=0.51.

210RA2cA intensity of an unobserved 7090-keV |a to 2+ state                     
210RA3cA is estimated as <0.93 per 100 |a decays by assuming                    
210RA4cA its hindrance factor to be <1 (the 2+ level energy of E(2+)|?600       
210RA5cA is used which is obtained by extrapolation from 2+ level energies in   
210RA6cA heavier radium isotopes). Possible |a transitions to higher level      
210RA7cA are neglected.
