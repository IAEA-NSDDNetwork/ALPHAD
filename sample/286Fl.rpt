286FL c  {+290}Lv from |a decay of {+294}118 which is formed in                 
286FL2c  {+249}Cf({+48}Ca,3n),E=251.7 MeV; {+249}Cf from                        
286FL3c  decay of {+249}Bk target; rotating {+249}Bk radioactive target.        
286FL c  Z=118 element discovered in 2004Og10: Prog Theor Phys (suppl) 154, 406;
286FL2c  and 2006Og05: Phys Rev C 74, 044602 through correlated |a-decay chain  
286FL3c  of three successive |a-decaying nuclides:                              
286FL4c  {+294}118 --> {+290}Lv --> {+286}Fl --> {+282}Cn; the last one decays  
286FL5c  by SF mode. 12 chains assigned to {+290}Lv were reported in 2006Og05   
286FL6c  and 2004Og07 (Phys Rev C 69, 054607). Consult XUNDL database for       
286FL7c  compiled datasets from 2006Og05 and 2004Og07. Results from 2004Og07    
286FL8c  are also available in the ENSDF database                               
286FL c  {+249}Bk radioactive target was produced in neutron irradiation of     
286FL2c  Cm and Am targets in high flux isotope reactor at ORNL. The chemically 
286FL3c  purified 12.7 mg of {+249}Bk (about half of the total {+249}Bk material
286FL4c  produced at ORNL) containing 0.51 mg of {+249}Cf with no other         
286FL5c  detectable impurities was shipped to JINR. Six targets were prepared at
286FL6c  RIAR facility in Russia, each target with a thickness of 0.33 mg/cm{+2}
286FL7c  deposited on 0.72 mg/cm{+2} thick Ti foils, and mounted on a disk that 
286FL8c  was rotated at 1700 rpm perpendicular to the beam direction.           
286FL c  Facility: U-400 cyclotron with the Dubna gas-filled recoil separator   
286FL2c  (DGFRS) of the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions,                 
286FL3c  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (JINR)                   
286FL c  Evaporation residues passing through the DGFRS separator registered by 
286FL2c  time-of-flight system. Focal plane detector system: two 6x6 cm{+2}     
286FL3c  Si detectors, each of 16 strips with position sensitivity in the       
286FL4c  vertical direction. These detectors were surrounded by six similar     
286FL5c  6x6 cm{+2} Si side detectors without position sensitivity. Behind the  
286FL6c  focal plane detectors, two veto Si detectors, similar to the side      
286FL7c  detectors, were mounted for detecting or rejecting signals from        
286FL8c  high-energy long-range charged particles produced in direct reactions  
286FL9c  of {+48}Ca with the DGFRS materials.                                   
286FL c  Measured E|a, half-lives, |a-|a correlations. FWHM for |a particles    
286FL2c  was 34-73 keV
