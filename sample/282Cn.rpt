282CN c  {+286}Fl from {+294}118 -> {+290}Lv -> {+286}Fl |a decay chain;        
282CN2c  {+294}118 is formed in {+249}Cf({+48}Ca,3n),E=251.7 MeV; {+249}Cf from 
282CN3c  decay of {+249}Bk target; rotating {+249}Bk radioactive target.        
282CN c  Z=118 element discovered in 2004Og10: Prog Theor Phys (suppl) 154, 406;
282CN2c  and 2006Og05: Phys Rev C 74, 044602 through correlated |a-decay chain  
282CN3c  of three successive |a-decaying nuclides:                              
282CN4c  {+294}118 --> {+290}Lv --> {+286}Fl --> {+282}Cn; the last one decays  
282CN5c  by SF mode. Many chains were assigned to {+286}Fl earlier in 2006Og05, 
282CN6c  2004Og07 (Phys Rev C 69, 054607) and 2004Og12 (Phys Rev C 70, 064609). 
282CN7c  Results from 2004Og07 and 2004Og12 are also available in the ENSDF     
282CN8c  database                                                               
282CN c  {+249}Bk radioactive target was produced in neutron irradiation of     
282CN2c  Cm and Am targets in high flux isotope reactor at ORNL. The chemically 
282CN3c  purified 12.7 mg of {+249}Bk (about half of the total {+249}Bk material
282CN4c  produced at ORNL) containing 0.51 mg of {+249}Cf with no other         
282CN5c  detectable impurities was shipped to JINR. Six targets were prepared at
282CN6c  RIAR facility in Russia, each target with a thickness of 0.33 mg/cm{+2}
282CN7c  deposited on 0.72 mg/cm{+2} thick Ti foils, and mounted on a disk that 
282CN8c  was rotated at 1700 rpm perpendicular to the beam direction.           
282CN c  Facility: U-400 cyclotron with the Dubna gas-filled recoil separator   
282CN2c  (DGFRS) of the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions,                 
282CN3c  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (JINR)                   
282CN c  Evaporation residues passing through the DGFRS separator registered by 
282CN2c  time-of-flight system. Focal plane detector system: two 6x6 cm{+2}     
282CN3c  Si detectors, each of 16 strips with position sensitivity in the       
282CN4c  vertical direction. These detectors were surrounded by six similar     
282CN5c  6x6 cm{+2} Si side detectors without position sensitivity. Behind the  
282CN6c  focal plane detectors, two veto Si detectors, similar to the side      
282CN7c  detectors, were mounted for detecting or rejecting signals from        
282CN8c  high-energy long-range charged particles produced in direct reactions  
282CN9c  of {+48}Ca with the DGFRS materials.                                   
282CN c  Measured E|a, half-lives, |a-|a correlations. FWHM for |a particles    
282CN2c  was 34-73 keV
